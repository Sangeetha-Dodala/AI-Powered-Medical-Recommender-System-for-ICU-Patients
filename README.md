# AI-Powered-Medical-Recommender-System-for-ICU-Patients
🧠 AI-Powered Medical Recommender System for ICU Patients

This project aims to develop an AI-driven medical recommender system to assist healthcare professionals in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). By leveraging machine learning and neural networks, the system analyzes patient data to suggest potential treatments, monitor vitals, and provide early warnings for critical conditions.

🚀 Features

Real-time analysis of ICU patient data

Predictive analytics using neural networks

Personalized treatment recommendations

Alert generation for abnormal patient vitals

Easy-to-use interface for healthcare professionals

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras

Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing

Streamlit (or Flask) for UI

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

📌 Goal
To improve patient outcomes in ICUs by providing intelligent, data-backed medical support recommendations using artificial intelligence.
